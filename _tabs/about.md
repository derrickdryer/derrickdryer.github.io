Hey there! I’m Derrick, an IT professional and military veteran passionate about networking, hardware, and system infrastructure. Originally from Monongahela, PA, I’m currently wrapping up my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems at Pennsylvania Western University, California, PA (graduating May 2025).

I’ve had the opportunity to work with Cisco networking, datacenter infrastructure, and system troubleshooting, both academically and professionally—including my time as a Student Workforce Trainee at the FBI and my experience in the U.S. Air Force maintaining F-35 aircraft systems.

This site serves as a place to document my tech journey, from networking projects to home lab experiments and whatever else I’m learning along the way. I believe that writing things down is the best way to truly understand them (and to avoid forgetting them later).

If you have a question, feel free to reach out or just drop by to check out my latest posts. Oh, and if you stumble upon a broken link or something weird, let me know!
